		That was FAST! <br> <br>
		Did you spot the target inside the circle? Because the series of letters and numbers are so fast, you may not always know the answer. <br> <br>
		Don't be frustrated, this is part of the experiment. <br> <br>
		As long as you are doing your best to concentrate, you are doing fine. <br> <br>
	</p>

	Here are a few things that will help: <br> <br>
		1. Take breaks between the different parts of the experiment <br> <br>
		2. There's no need to respond as fast as you can, but try to respond quickly. Guess if you don't know the answer. <br> <br>
