# attentionSpeedTask
Repository for a computer-based **Speed of Attention** task, developed using [Tatool Web](www.tatool-web.com) (von Bastian, Locher & Ruflin, 2013). The task was designed by **Dr Alon Zivony**, coded by **Eleanor Hyde**, with thanks to **Matthew Hyde** and **Prof Claudia von Bastian**.

## Description
Each trial begins with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500 ms, followed by a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream of up to 14 letters and numbers. Each item appears for 50 ms with an inter-stimulus interval of 50 ms. One digit (1â€“9) in the stream is surrounded by a circle, marking it as the target. After the stream, a blank screen is shown for 200 ms, followed by a question mark prompting the participant to respond by pressing the number key corresponding to the target digit. Practice trials: 2 slowed-down trials (1000 ms per item) followed by 2 normal-speed practice trials (50 ms per item). Experimental trials: 60 trials (50 ms per item). The task takes approximately **5 minutes** to complete.
